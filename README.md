## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YagizArikan/SkyBreaker.git
cd SkyBreaker

Minimalist, physics-driven “thrust & rotate” lander built in Unity. No fluff—tight controls, readable code, reusable components.

Controls: A = rotate left · D = rotate right · Space = thrust forward
Goal: thread the caverns, land on the pad, don’t smack the walls. ⚠️

## Features

- Rigidbody flight with stable FixedUpdate thrust/rotation

- Reactive audio + particles for engine and side thrusters

- Win/lose sequences with scene progression

## Quick Setup

Just open Build1 and enjoy
